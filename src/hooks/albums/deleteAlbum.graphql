# Each interaction layer domain has it's own graphql requests. This keeps it easier to reason about why certain fields are being requested.
# The code generator will create a `models` directory for each interaction layer domain and add the types for each graphql file to that domain-specific directory.
# A reference to the GraphQL schema is maintained in the global models directory.
